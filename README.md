Since obtaining my MSc in Clinical Psychology in 2011, I have undergone clinical and research training in the fields of neurodegenerative diseases and mental health. I have a particular interest in disorders of memory and language, and the application of computational approaches to improve health outcomes. I was recently awarded my PhD from St George's University (London, UK), during which I used Natural Language Processing techniques to extract linguistic features from speech, and trained machine learning models to a) classify early Alzheimer's disease, and b) predict current and future cognitive performance. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Badhwar MIND Lab, where my research is focused on using both structural and functional neuroimaging measures to find distinct subtypes of Alzheimer's disease.
